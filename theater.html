    <h3>Lines from The Anniversary - Anton Chekov</h3>

    <p>KHIRIN. Two... nought... nought... three... nine... two... nought. I
        can't see straight after all these figures.... Three... one... six...
        four... one... five.... [Uses the counting-frame.]
        
        SHIPUCHIN. Another unpleasantness.... This morning your wife came to
        see me and complained about you once again. Said that last night you
        threatened her and her sister with a knife. Kusma Nicolaievitch, what do
        you mean by that? Oh, oh!
        
        KHIRIN. [Rudely] As it's an anniversary, Andrey Andreyevitch, I'll ask
        for a special favour. Please, even if it's only out of respect for my
        toil, don't interfere in my family life. Please!
        
        SHIPUCHIN. [Sighs] Yours is an impossible character, Kusma
        Nicolaievitch! You're an excellent and respected man, but you behave to
        women like some scoundrel. Yes, really. I don't understand why you hate
        them so?
        
        KHIRIN. I wish I could understand why you love them so! [Pause.]
        
        SHIPUCHIN. The employees have just presented me with an album; and the
        Directors, as I've heard, are going to give me an address and a silver
        loving-cup.... [Playing with his monocle] Very nice, as my name's
        Shipuchin! It isn't excessive. A certain pomp is essential to the
        reputation of the Bank, devil take it! You know everything, of
        course.... I composed the address myself, and I bought the cup myself,
        too.... Well, then there was 45 roubles for the cover of the address,
        but you can't do without that. They'd never have thought of it for
        themselves. [Looks round] Look at the furniture! Just look at it! They
        say I'm stingy, that all I want is that the locks on the doors should
        be polished, that the employees should wear fashionable ties, and that
        a fat hall-porter should stand by the door. No, no, sirs. Polished locks
        and a fat porter mean a good deal. I can behave as I like at home, eat
        and sleep like a pig, get drunk....
        
        KHIRIN. Please don't make hints.
        
        SHIPUCHIN. Nobody's making hints! What an impossible character
        yours is.... As I was saying, at home I can live like a tradesman, a
        _parvenu_, and be up to any games I like, but here everything must be
        _en grand_. This is a Bank! Here every detail must _imponiren_, so to
        speak, and have a majestic appearance. [He picks up a paper from the
        floor and throws it into the fireplace] My service to the Bank has been
        just this--I've raised its reputation. A thing of immense importance is
        tone! Immense, as my name's Shipuchin! [Looks over KHIRIN] My dear man,
        a deputation of shareholders may come here any moment, and there you are
        in felt boots, wearing a scarf... in some absurdly coloured jacket....
        You might have put on a frock-coat, or at any rate a dark jacket....</p>
