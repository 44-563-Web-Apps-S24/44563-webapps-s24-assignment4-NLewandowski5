        <p class="direction">[The private office of the Chairman of Directors. On the left is a door,
        leading into the public department. There are two desks. The furniture
        aims at a deliberately luxurious effect, with armchairs covered in
        velvet, flowers, statues, carpets, and a telephone. It is midday. KHIRIN
        is alone; he wears long felt boots, and is shouting through the door.]</p>
        
        <h4 class="shipuchin">SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p class="direction">[At the door, addresses the outer office]</p> <p class="speech">This present, my
        dear colleagues, will be preserved to the day of my death, as a memory
        of the happiest days of my life! Yes, gentlemen! Once more, I thank you!</p>
        <p class="direction">[Throws a kiss into the air and turns to KHIRIN]</p> <p class="speech">My dear, my respected
        Kusma Nicolaievitch!</p>
        
        <p class="direction">[All the time that SHIPUCHIN is on the stage, clerks intermittently come
        in with papers for his signature and go out.]</p>
        
        <h4 class="khirin">KHIRIN.</h4> <p class="direction">[Standing up]</p> <p class="speech">I have the honour to congratulate you, Andrey
        Andreyevitch, on the fiftieth anniversary of our Bank, and hope that...</p>
        
        <h4 class="shipuchin">SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p class="direction">[Warmly shakes hands]</p> <p class="speech">Thank you, my dear sir! Thank you!
        I think that in view of the unique character of the day, as it is an
        anniversary, we may kiss each other!... </p><p class="direction">[They kiss]</p> <p class="speech">I am very, very
        glad! Thank you for your service... for everything! If, in the course of
        the time during which I have had the honour to be Chairman of this Bank
        anything useful has been done, the credit is due, more than to anybody
        else, to my colleagues.</p> <p class="direction">[Sighs]</p> <p class="speech">Yes, fifteen years! Fifteen years as my
        name's Shipuchin!</p> <p class="direction">[Changes his tone]</p> <p class="speech">Where's my report? Is it getting
        on?</p>
        
        <h4 class="khirin">KHIRIN.</h4> <p class="speech">Yes; there's only five pages left.</p>
        
        <h4 class="shipuchin">SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p class="speech">Excellent. Then it will be ready by three?</p>
        
        <h4 class="khirin">KHIRIN.</h4> <p class="speech">If nothing occurs to disturb me, I'll get it done. Nothing of
        any importance is now left.</p>
        
        <h4 class="shipuchin">SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p class="speech">Splendid. Splendid, as my name's Shipuchin! The general
        meeting will be at four. If you please, my dear fellow. Give me the
        first half, I'll peruse it.... Quick....</p> <p class="direction">[Takes the report]</p> <p class="speech">I base
        enormous hopes on this report. It's my _profession de foi_, or, better
        still, my firework.</p> <p class="direction">[Note: The actual word employed.]</p> <p class="speech">My firework, as my
        name's Shipuchin!</p> <p class="direction">[Sits and reads the report to himself]</p> <p class="speech">I'm hellishly
        tired.... My gout kept on giving me trouble last night, all the morning
        I was running about, and then these excitements, ovations, agitations...
        I'm tired!</p>
        
        <h4  class="khirin">KHIRIN.</h4> <p class="speech">Two... nought... nought... three... nine... two... nought. I
        can't see straight after all these figures.... Three... one... six...
