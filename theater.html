    <p>THE ANNIVERSARY


        CHARACTERS
        
           ANDREY ANDREYEVITCH SHIPUCHIN, Chairman of the N---- Joint Stock
           Bank, a middle-aged man, with a monocle
           TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA, his wife, aged 25
           KUSMA NICOLAIEVITCH KHIRIN, the bank's aged book-keeper
           NASTASYA FYODOROVNA MERCHUTKINA, an old woman wearing an old-fashioned
           cloak
           DIRECTORS OF THE BANK
           EMPLOYEES OF THE BANK
        
        The action takes place at the Bank
        
        
        [The private office of the Chairman of Directors. On the left is a door,
        leading into the public department. There are two desks. The furniture
        aims at a deliberately luxurious effect, with armchairs covered in
        velvet, flowers, statues, carpets, and a telephone. It is midday. KHIRIN
        is alone; he wears long felt boots, and is shouting through the door.]
        
        KHIRIN. Send out to the chemist for 15 copecks' worth of valerian drops,
        and tell them to bring some drinking water into the Directors' office!
        This is the hundredth time I've asked! [Goes to a desk] I'm absolutely
        tired out. This is the fourth day I've been working, without a chance of
        shutting my eyes. From morning to evening I work here, from evening to
        morning at home. [Coughs] And I've got an inflammation all over me.
        I'm hot and cold, and I cough, and my legs ache, and there's something
        dancing before my eyes. [Sits] Our scoundrel of a Chairman, the brute,
        is going to read a report at a general meeting. "Our Bank, its Present
        and Future." You'd think he was a Gambetta.... [At work] Two... one...
        one... six... nought... seven.... Next, six... nought... one... six....
        He just wants to throw dust into people's eyes, and so I sit here and
        work for him like a galley-slave! This report of his is poetic fiction
        and nothing more, and here I've got to sit day after day and add
        figures, devil take his soul! [Rattles on his counting-frame] I can't
        stand it! [Writing] That is, one... three... seven... two... one...
        nought.... He promised to reward me for my work. If everything goes well
        to-day and the public is properly put into blinkers, he's promised me a
        gold charm and 300 roubles bonus.... We'll see. [Works] Yes, but if
        my work all goes for nothing, then you'd better look out.... I'm very
        excitable.... If I lose my temper I'm capable of committing some crime,
        so look out! Yes!
        
        [Noise and applause behind the scenes. SHIPUCHIN'S voice: "Thank
        you! Thank you! I am extremely grateful." Enter SHIPUCHIN. He wears
        a frockcoat and white tie; he carries an album which has been just
        presented to him.]
        
        SHIPUCHIN. [At the door, addresses the outer office] This present, my
        dear colleagues, will be preserved to the day of my death, as a memory
        of the happiest days of my life! Yes, gentlemen! Once more, I thank you!
        [Throws a kiss into the air and turns to KHIRIN] My dear, my respected
        Kusma Nicolaievitch!
        
        [All the time that SHIPUCHIN is on the stage, clerks intermittently come
        in with papers for his signature and go out.]
        
        KHIRIN. [Standing up] I have the honour to congratulate you, Andrey
        Andreyevitch, on the fiftieth anniversary of our Bank, and hope that...
        
        SHIPUCHIN. [Warmly shakes hands] Thank you, my dear sir! Thank you!
        I think that in view of the unique character of the day, as it is an
        anniversary, we may kiss each other!... [They kiss] I am very, very
        glad! Thank you for your service... for everything! If, in the course of
        the time during which I have had the honour to be Chairman of this Bank
        anything useful has been done, the credit is due, more than to anybody
        else, to my colleagues. [Sighs] Yes, fifteen years! Fifteen years as my
        name's Shipuchin! [Changes his tone] Where's my report? Is it getting
        on?
        
        KHIRIN. Yes; there's only five pages left.
        
        SHIPUCHIN. Excellent. Then it will be ready by three?
        
        KHIRIN. If nothing occurs to disturb me, I'll get it done. Nothing of
        any importance is now left.
        
        SHIPUCHIN. Splendid. Splendid, as my name's Shipuchin! The general
        meeting will be at four. If you please, my dear fellow. Give me the
        first half, I'll peruse it.... Quick.... [Takes the report] I base
        enormous hopes on this report. It's my _profession de foi_, or, better
        still, my firework. [Note: The actual word employed.] My firework, as my
        name's Shipuchin! [Sits and reads the report to himself] I'm hellishly
        tired.... My gout kept on giving me trouble last night, all the morning
        I was running about, and then these excitements, ovations, agitations...
        I'm tired!
        
        KHIRIN. Two... nought... nought... three... nine... two... nought. I
        can't see straight after all these figures.... Three... one... six...
        four... one... five.... [Uses the counting-frame.]</p>
