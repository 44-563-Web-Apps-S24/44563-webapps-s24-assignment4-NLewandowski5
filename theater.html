    <p>THE ANNIVERSARY


        CHARACTERS
        
           ANDREY ANDREYEVITCH SHIPUCHIN, Chairman of the N---- Joint Stock
           Bank, a middle-aged man, with a monocle
           TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA, his wife, aged 25
           KUSMA NICOLAIEVITCH KHIRIN, the bank's aged book-keeper
           NASTASYA FYODOROVNA MERCHUTKINA, an old woman wearing an old-fashioned
           cloak
           DIRECTORS OF THE BANK
           EMPLOYEES OF THE BANK
        
        The action takes place at the Bank</p>
        
        
        <p>[The private office of the Chairman of Directors. On the left is a door,
        leading into the public department. There are two desks. The furniture
        aims at a deliberately luxurious effect, with armchairs covered in
        velvet, flowers, statues, carpets, and a telephone. It is midday. KHIRIN
        is alone; he wears long felt boots, and is shouting through the door.]</p>
        
        <h4>SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p>[At the door, addresses the outer office]</p> <p>This present, my
        dear colleagues, will be preserved to the day of my death, as a memory
        of the happiest days of my life! Yes, gentlemen! Once more, I thank you!</p>
        <p>[Throws a kiss into the air and turns to KHIRIN]</p> <p>My dear, my respected
        Kusma Nicolaievitch!</p>
        
        <p>[All the time that SHIPUCHIN is on the stage, clerks intermittently come
        in with papers for his signature and go out.]</p>
        
        <h4>KHIRIN.</h4> <p>[Standing up]</p> <p>I have the honour to congratulate you, Andrey
        Andreyevitch, on the fiftieth anniversary of our Bank, and hope that...</p>
        
        <h4>SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p>[Warmly shakes hands]</p> <p>Thank you, my dear sir! Thank you!
        I think that in view of the unique character of the day, as it is an
        anniversary, we may kiss each other!... </p><p>[They kiss]</p> <p>I am very, very
        glad! Thank you for your service... for everything! If, in the course of
        the time during which I have had the honour to be Chairman of this Bank
        anything useful has been done, the credit is due, more than to anybody
        else, to my colleagues.</p> <p>[Sighs]</p> <p>Yes, fifteen years! Fifteen years as my
        name's Shipuchin!</p> <p>[Changes his tone]</p> <p>Where's my report? Is it getting
        on?</p>
        
        <h4>KHIRIN.</h4> <p>Yes; there's only five pages left.</p>
        
        <h4>SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p>Excellent. Then it will be ready by three?</p>
        
        <h4>KHIRIN.</h4> <p>If nothing occurs to disturb me, I'll get it done. Nothing of
        any importance is now left.</p>
        
        <h4>SHIPUCHIN.</h4> <p>Splendid. Splendid, as my name's Shipuchin! The general
        meeting will be at four. If you please, my dear fellow. Give me the
        first half, I'll peruse it.... Quick....</p> <p>[Takes the report]</p> <p>I base
        enormous hopes on this report. It's my _profession de foi_, or, better
        still, my firework.</p> <p>[Note: The actual word employed.]</p> <p>My firework, as my
        name's Shipuchin!</p> <p>[Sits and reads the report to himself]</p> <p>I'm hellishly
        tired.... My gout kept on giving me trouble last night, all the morning
        I was running about, and then these excitements, ovations, agitations...
        I'm tired!</p>
        
        <h4>KHIRIN.</h4> <p>Two... nought... nought... three... nine... two... nought. I
        can't see straight after all these figures.... Three... one... six...
        four... one... five....</p> <p>[Uses the counting-frame.]</p>
